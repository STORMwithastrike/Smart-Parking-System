# Smart-Parking-System
A VHDL-based Smart Parking System that uses a DE10-Lite FPGA to manage an 8-spot parking lot. It uses two KY-032 IR sensors for vehicle detection and an SG-90 servo motor for gate movement. Features include a 7-segment display counter and a switch to toggle between manual and autonomous entry modes (CSEN 605: Digital System Design Course Project).
