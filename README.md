# Smart-Parking-System
A VHDL-based Smart Parking System that uses a DE10-Lite FPGA to manage an 8-spot parking lot. It uses two KY-032 IR sensors for vehicle detection and an SG-90 servo motor for gate movement. Features include a 7-segment display counter and a switch to toggle between manual and autonomous entry modes (CSEN 605: Digital System Design Course Project).

## 💡Project Idea
The purpose of this project is to create a smart parking system. Initially, The number of empty
spots is 8 and it works in 2 modes. The autonomous mode makes use of 2 sensors such that when
the first sensor detects a car, the gate opens using a servo motor. The second sensor detects when
a car has passed the gate. When it detects the presence of the car, the number of empty spots
decrement by 1. The manual mode works by pressing a button which opens and closes the gate.
When it closes the gate, it decrements the number of empty spots by 1. There’s also a reset
button that when pressed, returns the counter to 8 in any mode. The logic for the program is done
entirely in VHDL.
